Fewer (meaningful) social connections = higher polarization BUT only at the low end.

\begin{frame}[c]{Results: Assortativity and Agent Openness}  % Justin

% Walk them through what the axes are.
% Make the point that "if openness is zero, no one ever changes their mind, and
% so we would of course get zero assortativity (just random opinions)."
% 

% Higher openness can be viewed in two ways. It could mean "more open-minded
% and receptive to others' opinions." But it could also mean "more willing to
% blindly follow the opinions you hear around you." This latter interpretation
% is why we (paradoxically) see lower polarization for lower openness values.
% Takeaway: if a society's average openness is hovering between, say, .2 and
% .3, a little more critical thinking could move things left past the tipping
% point and end up with a less polarized society.

% TODO: Justin: put in a sentence here summarizing the findings you will
% articulate.

\begin{frame}[c]{Polarization Proxy \#2: Issue Alignment} % Stephen

We define \textbf{Issue Alignment} (IA) as the tendency for people who agree on
one issue to also agree on other (unrelated) issues.

If people generally adhere to an entire suite of opinions, we term that society
``Issue Aligned'' and claim this is an indication of polarization.

%\textbf{Issue Alignment} (IA): the tendency for people who agree on one issue
%to also agree on other (unrelated) issues.

\begin{frame}[c]{A third possible explanation for IA} % Stephen

\large
Our model demonstrates that neither ideological coherence nor media influence
is necessary for IA to develop. \textbf{Cross-issue influence} (CI2) is
sufficient.

\pause
\normalsize
\bigskip

This may have wide-reaching implications on how we interpret the causes of the
polarization phenomenon, and what societal changes might be necessary to reduce
it.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Cross-Issue Influence (Positive)}  % Stephen

We define \textbf{Cross-Issue Influence} (CI2) as the effect that an agent can
have on one of its neighbor's opinions based on their agreement (or
disagreement) on a \textit{different} issue. (Traditional BC models have used
``I2.'')

\begin{frame}[c]{Quantifying IA} % Stephen

To measure the degree of Issue Alignment in a virtual society, we measure the
number of distinct opinion \textbf{buckets} that exist.

\bigskip
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep.1em

\item A ``bucket'' is a specific set of numerical opinions on the various issues.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep.1em
\item For example: ``issue 1: 0.4, issue 2: 1.0, issue 3: 1.0.''
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item At any point in simulated time, each agent is in one bucket, possibly with
other agents.

\pause
\item \textit{All agents in the same bucket agree on all the issues}, within a
threshold of $\varepsilon$ (.05).

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Interpretation} % Stephen

\large
We interpret \textbf{fewer buckets} to mean \textbf{more Issue Alignment} (and hence, more polarization).

\pause

\bigskip
One other bit of lingo:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep.1em
\item If a pair of agents agrees on \textit{every} issue (\textit{i.e.}, they're in
the same bucket), we call them \textbf{clones} (or a ``clone pair.'')

\bigskip

\item If a pair of agents \underline{dis}agrees on every issue, we call them
\textbf{anti-clones} (or an ``anti-clone pair.'')

% Tuck-away slide
%\begin{frame}[c]{Diametricity}
%
%One other way to define polarization is extremity of views.
%
%Fact: if CI2 is employed, the model always (?) produces exactly two buckets,
%and all the opinions in those buckets are at the poles.
%
%Fact: if only I2 is employed, there will normally be many buckets (often one
%for each combination of fully-polarized opinions; i.e., a (0,0,0) bucket, a
%(0,0,1), (0,0,2), (0,1,0), ...)
%
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Discussion and takeaways}  % Stephen & Justin

%Justin:
Lower network density leads to higher polarization. Takeaway: people need to
get out more.

%(If you are hearing from more individuals, you will be likely to
%hear a more diverse set of opinions and won't get in an echo chamber as
%easily.)

\pause
%Justin:
If people are ``too open'' and easily believe what they hear, this can lead to
echo chambers forming more readily. Takeaway: be more cautious and discerning
about what you hear.
% could mention "openness is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you want to
% be open to others' viewpoints. On the other hand, if you're too gullible, it
% can make echo chambers happen more readily."

\pause
% Stephen:
IA endogenously appears with CI2. We can't solely blame media outlets or
ideologies.

\pause
Individual fix: Allow yourself the freedom to agree with someone on one thing
and disagree with them on something else.

\pause
Society's fix: parties and global media outlets undoubtedly reinforce the IA
phenomenon. We need voices from more buckets!
