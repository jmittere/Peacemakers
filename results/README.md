# Results
Each Folder is for each different Graph model, ER (Erdos-Renyi)...etc. 

Each subfolder name is the name of the dependent variable being analyzed in that folder then the independent variable being changed in that folder. 
For example, BucketsAgents would be a folder that has results with number of buckets as the dependent variable and the number of agents as the independent variable.
